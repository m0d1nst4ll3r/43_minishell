Tasks:
- Display a prompt when waiting for a new command
- Have a working history
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path)
- Use at most one global variable to indicate a received signal
	- What does that mean... ?!?!
	- Using "norm" type structures in the global scope is forbidden... !?!
- \ ; and posibly other special characters not required by the subject can be ignored
- Handle '' and ""
	- '' prevents shell from interpreting meta-characters in the quoted sequence
	- "" works as '' but does not prevent $ interpretation
- Handle < > << >> (like pipex basically, even heredoc)
- Handle |
- Handle environment variables $
- Handle $? which expands to exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline
- Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D, ctrl-\
	- ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line
	- ctrl-D exits shell
	- ctrl-\ does nothing
		- .......?!?!?!
- Built-in commands
	- echo with option -n
	- cd with only a relative or absolute path
	- pwd (no options)
	- export (no options)
	- unset (no options)
	- env (no options or args)
	- exit (no options)
- readline() may cause memory leaks, we ignore this


Bonus tasks:
- Handle && and || with parenthesis for priorities
- Wildcards * should work for the current directory
	- ...?
